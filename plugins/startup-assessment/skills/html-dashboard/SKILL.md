# HTML Dashboard & Report Generation Skill

## Overview

The html-dashboard skill provides agents with comprehensive patterns and templates for generating professional reports in the startup assessment workflow. This skill covers four distinct output types that are produced at the conclusion of each assessment phase:

**User-facing deliverables:**

1. **HTML Interactive Report** — Multi-tab executive dashboard and detailed analysis
2. **Word Editable Report (.docx)** — Adaptive format based on assessor type (investment, credit, or strategic); for review, comments, track changes, and stakeholder collaboration

**Internal pipeline files (generated but not surfaced to user):**

3. **Scored Module Register** — JSON export containing all readiness and fit-to-purpose scores
4. **Research Provenance Register** — JSON export containing source citations and confidence levels

The skill is designed for professional assessors (venture capital, private equity, credit analysts, corporate strategists, family offices, sovereign wealth funds) who need to evaluate startup business cases and deliver actionable determinations. All reports are self-contained (inline CSS/JS with optional CDN links) and require no external dependencies beyond trusted content delivery networks.

### Design System

**All colors, typography, spacing, component proportions, chart palettes, and quality standards are defined in the centralized design system: `skills/design-system/SKILL.md`.** Read and follow that file for all visual specifications. It is the single source of truth — do not define alternate color values or typography in report outputs.

The design system also contains the **Quality Contract** — the minimum quality bar for all outputs, benchmarked against top-tier management consultancies, leading VC firms, major credit agencies, and certified valuation professionals. Every output must meet that contract.

### Key Principles

- **Self-Contained HTML**: Single-file reports with all styling and interactivity embedded
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts that work across all screen sizes (1200px+, 768px, 480px breakpoints)
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, color-blind friendly palettes, alt text for all visuals, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation
- **Professional Appearance**: Enterprise-grade typography, spacing, and color schemes — indistinguishable from McKinsey/Sequoia/S&P quality
- **Deterministic Output**: Reproducible formatting with consistent naming conventions
- **Data Integrity**: JSON exports preserve raw scores and provenance for audit trails
- **Print Readiness**: Every HTML report must render cleanly when printed via browser with proper page breaks, margins, and preserved chart colors

---

## Output Manifest

All outputs follow a consistent naming convention: `[CompanyName]_[Phase]_[YYYY-MM-DD].[ext]`

### Example: Company "TechVenture Inc." assessed on 2026-03-08

| Output | Filename | Format | Purpose |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| HTML Report | `TechVenture-Inc_pre-assessment_2026-03-08.html` | HTML5 (self-contained) | Interactive dashboard, domain analysis, gap register, research log |
| Word Report | `TechVenture-Inc_pre-assessment_2026-03-08.docx` | Word (.docx) | Editable document for review, comments, track changes; export to PDF when finalised |
| Scored Register | `TechVenture-Inc_pre-assessment_2026-03-08_scores.json` | JSON | Machine-readable scores, weights, domain details |
| Provenance Register | `TechVenture-Inc_pre-assessment_2026-03-08_provenance.json` | JSON | Source citations, confidence levels, methodology notes |

### Phase-Specific Outputs

The assessment workflow consists of four phases, each generating a full output set:

1. **Pre-Assessment** — Framework setup, domain activation, initial framework configuration
2. **Assessment** — Full domain evaluation, module scoring, final determination
3. **Sensitivity Analysis** — Robustness testing, scenario analysis, flip-point identification
4. **Recommendations** — Path identification, improvement roadmaps, deal term suggestions

## HTML Report Architecture

### Multi-Tab Structure

Each HTML report contains a tab-based navigation system that allows assessors to explore different aspects of the evaluation. The tab bar is sticky (remains visible while scrolling) and supports keyboard navigation.

### Self-Contained Design

All HTML reports are generated as single `.html` files that can be:
- Opened directly in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Emailed without attachment complexity
- Archived with confidence in long-term readability
- Exported to PDF from Word for permanent records

External dependencies are limited to:
- Google Fonts CDN (Inter typeface)
- Chart.js CDN (for interactive charts)
- No backend services required

All CSS is inline (within `<style>` tags) and all JavaScript is inline (within `<script>` tags).

### Responsive Design Principles

- **Desktop (1200px+)**: Full multi-column layouts, side-by-side charts
- **Tablet (768px–1200px)**: Single-column primary content, stacked sidebar panels
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Full-width single-column, collapsible sections, optimized typography

### Color Coding

All semantic colors (determinations, severity, confidence, assessment modes, chart series, score-to-color gradient) are defined in `skills/design-system/SKILL.md`. Use the CSS custom properties template from that file in every HTML report's `<style>` block to ensure consistency.

Embed the design system's `:root` CSS custom properties block at the top of every report's `<style>` section, then reference them throughout (e.g., `color: var(--color-go)`, `background: var(--color-critical)`).

---

## Executive Dashboard Tab (Landing Page)

The Executive Dashboard is the first tab in every HTML report and serves as the landing page. It provides a complete visual summary of the assessment in a single scrollable page.

### Dashboard Sections (top-to-bottom)

### Mandatory Disclosure Sections (All Formats)

Every report output — HTML and Word (.docx) — must include the following three disclosure sections. These are non-negotiable compliance requirements, not optional content.

#### 1. AI-Generated Assessment Disclosure

Must appear on the cover page or executive summary page of every report. Use this exact language (adapt company/tool name as needed):

```
AI-ASSISTED ASSESSMENT DISCLOSURE

This assessment was generated with AI assistance using Claude (Anthropic). The AI system
conducted research, scored modules, identified gaps, and structured findings. All scores,
determinations, and recommendations were reviewed and confirmed by a human assessor at five
confirmation points throughout the workflow. The assessor retains final authority over all
conclusions. AI-generated content should be independently verified before use in investment
decisions. The AI model's knowledge has a training cutoff and may not reflect the most
recent developments. All external research was conducted via live retrieval with source
attribution documented in the Research Provenance appendix.
```

**Standards basis:** EU AI Act Article 13 (transparency), ASA AI Guidance (disclosure of AI use), SEC 2026 Exam Priorities (accuracy of AI-related disclosures), IOSCO AI/ML Principles (governance and transparency).

#### 2. Limitations and Disclaimers

Must appear as a dedicated section in every report (typically before appendices). Content adapts per phase but must always include:

```
LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS

Scope: This assessment evaluates the business case submission and publicly available
information as of [assessment_date]. It does not constitute a complete due diligence
investigation, legal opinion, financial advice, or valuation.

Data limitations: Findings are based on information provided by the submitter and
independently retrieved from public sources. Non-public information, trade secrets,
and privileged communications were not available. Research confidence levels are
documented per finding in the Research Provenance appendix.

Methodology: Scoring follows a structured two-track methodology (Readiness and
Fit-to-Purpose) documented in the Assessment Framework appendix. Methodology version:
[version]. The methodology has not been validated against investment outcomes.

Forward-looking statements: Projections, scenarios, and recommendations are
forward-looking and inherently uncertain. Actual outcomes may differ materially.

Not investment advice: This assessment is an analytical tool to support professional
judgment. It does not replace independent due diligence, legal counsel, or financial
advisory services. Investment decisions should not be made solely on the basis of
this assessment.
```

**Standards basis:** AICPA VS 100 (assumptions and limiting conditions), IVS 106 (reporting requirements), IC memo best practices (limitations section).

#### 3. Independence Disclosure

Must appear on the cover page or in the report metadata section:

```
INDEPENDENCE STATEMENT

This assessment was conducted using a standardized methodology applied consistently
to all submissions. The assessment tool has no financial interest in the outcome of
any assessment. [If applicable: The assessor's relationship to the submitter, if any,
is disclosed in the Assessor Profile section.]
```

**Standards basis:** AICPA VS 100 (independence disclosure), ASA BV Standards (conflict disclosure), IVS (ethical principles — non-biased).

#### 4. Standards Alignment Appendix

Must appear as the final appendix section in every report (HTML and Word). This is a transparency disclosure — it describes which professional principles informed the methodology. It does **not** claim certification, accreditation, or compliance with any standard.

**Section header:**

Demonstrability Key:
  Output          — Directly verifiable in this report's content
  Methodology     — Verifiable by examining scoring logic and data governance
  Internal Process — Requires independent audit; not fully demonstrable per-report
```

**Standards basis:** IOSCO CRA Code (methodology transparency), IVS 105 (valuation approaches), EU AI Act Art 13 (transparency obligations). The appendix itself fulfills the meta-requirement of making standards application visible to the report consumer.

**Implementation notes:**
- This section must appear in **every** report output (all phases: Pre-Assessment, Assessment, Sensitivity, Recommendations)
- In HTML reports, render as the last sub-section of the Appendix tab
- In Word reports, render as the final appendix section before the back cover
- The table must adapt dynamically: only include rows for standards that were actually exercised in this assessment (e.g., omit ILPA DDQ row if no ESG modules were activated)
- CP timestamps must be actual timestamps from the session, not placeholders
- Methodology version must match the version declared in scoring-rubric SKILL.md

---

### Common Word Document Elements (All Formats)

Generated using `python-docx`. The Word format enables the assessor to review, annotate with comments, track changes, and circulate drafts before finalising. Export to PDF from Word when ready to lock.

- **Cover Page Design**: Professional letterhead, company name, assessment date, confidentiality footer, AI disclosure badge
- **Headers/Footers**: Page numbers, date, company name, assessor/fund name, "CONFIDENTIAL - For Internal Use Only"
- **Typography** (set via `python-docx` styles):
  - Heading 1 (Section titles): 18pt, bold, color accent (determination color)
  - Heading 2 (Subsections): 14pt, bold, dark gray
  - Body: 11pt, line spacing 1.5, dark gray/charcoal
  - Monospace: 9pt for tables and data
- **Tables**:
  - Gray header row (shading via `python-docx` cell shading)
  - Alternating white/light-gray row backgrounds for readability
  - Borders: thin, light gray
- **Color Scheme**: White background, dark text, accent color for headers/highlights based on determination
- **Page Breaks**: Logical breaks before major sections
- **Appendix Formatting**: Smaller font for reference material, clear section labeling

## Chart and Visualization Patterns

### Domain Score Radar Chart

Uses Chart.js library via CDN. Displays all 10 domains with two overlaid datasets (Readiness + Fit-to-Purpose).

**Integration:** See `references/chart-patterns.md` for full working snippet

### Gap Severity Distribution Bar Chart

Horizontal bar chart showing count of gaps by severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

**Integration:** See `references/chart-patterns.md` for full working snippet

### Score Comparison Bar Chart

Side-by-side bar chart comparing Readiness vs Fit-to-Purpose scores for each domain.

**Integration:** See `references/chart-patterns.md` for full working snippet

### Domain Score Heatmap Grid

CSS Grid-based heatmap (no Chart.js required) displaying 10 domain cells with color interpolation from red → amber → green.

**Integration:** See `references/chart-patterns.md` for full working snippet

### Score Color Interpolation

Function to convert 0–100 score to RGB color (red → amber → green gradient).

```javascript
function scoreToColor(score) {
  if (score < 50) {
    // Red to Amber: 0 → 50
    const ratio = score / 50;
    const r = 239;
    const g = Math.round(158 + (94 - 158) * ratio);
    const b = 68;
    return `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`;
  } else {
    // Amber to Green: 50 → 100
    const ratio = (score - 50) / 50;
    const r = Math.round(245 - (245 - 34) * ratio);
    const g = Math.round(158 + (85 - 158) * ratio);
    const b = Math.round(15 + (39 - 15) * ratio);
    return `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`;
  }
}
```

## Styling Standards

All typography, colors, spacing, component proportions, badge specs, score display formats, and table formatting standards are defined in `skills/design-system/SKILL.md`. Reference that file for:

- **Typography**: Inter font, type scale, monospace for data
- **Light theme surfaces**: Background, card, elevated, border, text colors
- **Component proportions**: Badges, cards, tables, score bars, score rings, tabs, buttons
- **Number formatting**: Commas for thousands, 1 decimal for percentages, $M/$K for currencies
- **Score display**: Percentage bars, SVG rings, scoreToColor() gradient

Do not redefine these values in reports — use the CSS custom properties from the design system.

---

## Inline HTML Template Pattern

Agents must generate HTML reports as complete, valid HTML5 documents with all CSS and JavaScript inline. No external file dependencies are permitted (CDN links for Chart.js and Google Fonts are acceptable).

### Template Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>{{COMPANY_NAME}} - {{PHASE_NAME}} Report</title>
  <!-- CDN Links -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@3.9.1/dist/chart.min.js"></script>

  <!-- Inline CSS -->
  <style>
    /* All styling here - no external stylesheets */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Tab Navigation -->
  <nav class="tab-nav">
    <!-- Tabs here -->
  </nav>

  <!-- Tab Content Panels -->
  <div class="tab-content">
    <!-- Panels here -->
  </div>

  <!-- Inline JavaScript -->
  <script>
    // All interactivity here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Variable Substitution Pattern

Use double-curly-brace syntax for template variables:
- `{{COMPANY_NAME}}` — Company name
- `{{PHASE_NAME}}` — Phase (Pre-Assessment / Assessment / Sensitivity / Recommendations)
- `{{ASSESSMENT_DATE}}` — Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `{{ASSESSOR_NAME}}` — Assessor or analyst name
- `{{DETERMINATION}}` — Final determination (GO / CONDITIONAL_GO / CONDITIONAL_HOLD / NO_GO)
- `{{READINESS_SCORE}}` — Overall readiness % (e.g., 76.5)
- `{{FIT_SCORE}}` — Overall fit-to-purpose % (e.g., 72.3)
- `{{DOMAIN_SCORES}}` — JSON-formatted domain scores (for chart data)
- `{{GAP_DATA}}` — JSON-formatted gap list (for table population)
- `{{STRENGTHS_LIST}}` — HTML bullet list of top 3 strengths
- `{{RISKS_LIST}}` — HTML bullet list of top 3 risks

### No External Dependencies

All CSS must be inline. All JavaScript must be inline. The only external resources allowed:
- Google Fonts CDN (for Inter typeface)
- Chart.js CDN (for charts)
- Trusted emoji or icon CDN (if icons are used)

The generated HTML file must be:
- Valid HTML5
- Openable in any modern browser without server-side rendering
- Printable via browser without loss of information
- Fully functional when emailed or transferred (no broken links)

## References Index

Detailed implementation patterns and code snippets are available in supporting reference files:

- **`references/chart-patterns.md`** — Chart.js implementations (radar, bar, heatmap), color interpolation, responsive sizing
- **`references/component-library.md`** — Reusable HTML/CSS components (badges, cards, tables, tabs, alerts, etc.)
- **`templates/base.html`** — Complete working HTML template skeleton ready for variable substitution

For specific implementation guidance, consult the appropriate reference file based on your task.

## Quick Start for Agents

When tasked with generating a report:

1. **Read `skills/design-system/SKILL.md`** — this is the single source of truth for all visual identity and quality standards
2. **Determine the phase**: Pre-Assessment, Assessment, Sensitivity, or Recommendations
3. **Embed the CSS custom properties** from the design system in the report's `<style>` block
4. **Build components** using patterns from `references/component-library.md` — these must use the design system's colors via CSS custom properties
5. **Add charts** using patterns from `references/chart-patterns.md` — chart colors must match the design system's chart series palette
6. **Structure content adaptively** — choose which tabs, sections, charts, and narratives best serve this specific case. The tab structures in this file are reference patterns, not rigid templates
7. **Include mandatory disclosures** — AI disclosure, limitations, independence statement, and Standards Alignment Appendix (see Mandatory Disclosure Sections). The Standards Alignment Appendix must appear in every report's Appendix tab
8. **Apply the quality contract** from the design system — meet every checkbox in the Visual Quality Floor, Interactivity Floor, Print Readiness, and Professional Standards sections
9. **Adapt tone to assessor type** — use the Assessor-Type Tone Adaptation table from the design system
10. **Validate**: Open in browser to verify rendering, responsiveness, print preview, and interactivity
11. **Generate Word report** using `python-docx` — apply the same structure, styles, and design system tokens as the HTML report
12. **Deliver user-facing outputs** (HTML + Word) — internal pipeline files (JSON, MD) are saved silently
